# Oblivio

## Algorithm designed to fetch Chrome OS devices that lay unused beyond a certain timeframe. 
### Thank you 
Oblivio is a separate module that uses GAM by Jay0Lee to query the G suite domain for devices in the domain. Without his and fellow contributor's efforts, Oblivio would not exist in the way it does today in terms of simplicity and minimalistic approach. 

Any contributions and / or feedback to this project is more than welcome.

### Use case
The main goal with Oblivio is to create an automated way to list unused or forgotten CROS devices in your domain in a Google Sheet. This way you can save time and money in your organization with better transparency of how many CROS devies are actually used and which ones that can be repurposed or maybe even deprovisioned if they're lost or sold.

### How to use
Oblivio is currently not ready for distribution, but this will later explain how to use Oblivio.
